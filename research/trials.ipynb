The busy streets of Toronto \\noffer many fantastic opportunities to practise your English language skills. Let’s take a \\nlook at 10 ways to challenge your knowledge of the language and learn to use it in a \\nvariety of real-life situations. \\n \\n1.  Find the hidden gem on the 5th floor of the Toronto \\nReference Library \\nCheck out the Language Centre on the 5th floor of the Toronto Reference Library, \\nwhich can be found at 789 Yonge Street, Toronto, ON M4W 2G8.  Here, you can \\npractise your listening and pronunciation skills for free, since the centre is equipped \\nwith headphones and audio/DVD/video-players. \\nThis is also the perfect place to make some new friends! You’ll be surrounded by other \\nstudents just like you, looking to connect and practise English. Find out more info \\nabout this at the official website for the Toronto Reference Library. \\nhttp://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?R=LIB018  \\n \\nBEGINNER LEVEL TIP: Step out of your comfort zone by talking to someone at \\nthe library, whether it’s a member of staff or a fellow library user (whisper, \\nbecause it’s a library). Ask for help with finding a specific book or genre.'),\n",

Join an English conversation circle \\nYou should also visit the TPL (Toronto Public Library) and hang around for an English \\nconversation circle. This is open to anyone who would like to practise their speaking \\nskills, and is designed to help speakers immerse themselves in Canadian culture. Find \\nout more about this program and how to join on the official TPL website. \\n \\n3. Go on an art tour at the University of Toronto  \\nDo you want a 3-in-1 experience when you visit the University of Toronto? Go on a free \\nart tour of the Hart House, hosted by a university student.  \\nAs you are guided through the 650-piece art collection at the University, you will get \\nto practise your listening and speaking skills. Don’t forget to interact and ask \\nquestions! \\nFind out more information about the Hart House at University of Toronto, and the \\nschedule for the free tours, at the Art Museum’s official website.  \\n \\n4. Watch a movie in unique surroundings \\nWatching a movie at a drive-in theatre surrounded by water is certainly a quirky way \\nto practise your listening skills. You can enjoy this at the Polson Pier Drive-in Theatre. \\nADVANCED LEVEL TIP: If you see something you like at a stall, try to politely \\nask the vendor something about it. You could ask about the price, colour, or \\nsize if it`s a piece of clothing. Don`t be shy – Canadians are known for their \\nfriendliness! \\n \\n5. Shop at St. Lawrence’s Market \\nMarkets are more personal than bigger shops, giving you the opportunity to practise \\nyour conversation skills. Why not try visiting the famous St. Lawrence Market in \\nToronto and make a promise to yourself to buy something only if you made a \\nconversation with the vendor.'),\n",

Even if you aren’t a fan, do it for language benefits. You \\ncan simply look up the lyrics online and listen to the song a few times. Then \\ndiscover new vocabulary by looking up the words you don’t know in your \\ndictionary!   \\n \\n6. Go to a live concert \\nThere is an unlimited supply of live music to suit all tastes and moods in Toronto. This \\nis a perfect environment that will help you feel comfortable interacting with locals \\nand practising your English skills! Don’t shy away if you don’t speak much English, \\ninstead, talk to the fellow music-lovers next to you, and try to make friends. \\n \\n7. Order up at the restaurant \\nWhen you eat out in Toronto, you’ll have the perfect opportunity to use your English \\nskills by reading menus and ordering your food. This is the time to use all of that that \\n‘at the restaurant’ vocabulary you have learnt in the classroom. \\nBEGINNER LEVEL TIP: Don’t just point to the item on the menu that you want \\nto order, read it out loud. This will get you out of your comfort zone and help \\nyou improve your language skills. The waiter will probably repeat the order to \\nyou to make sure that it is written down correctly.   \\n \\n8. Go on a street-art tour \\nWhen y ou think of art, galleries and museums immediately come to mind. Well, \\nToronto has a special treat in store; you can enjoy a Graffiti Tour at the famous Graffiti \\nAlley on Queen St. West (the only place in Toronto where graffiti is legal). \\n \\nIt’s great to be able to p ractise English by going on a guided tour. There are many \\norganisers that offer FREE tours. ‘Tour Guys’ is a company in Toronto that organises \\nfree or ‘pay what you like’ tours of the famous alley. You can check out their Facebook \\npage here: https://www.facebook.com/TourGuys/.'),\n",

Go to the Islands \\nFeel like a tourist and learn like a student by joining a guided tour to the Islands. You \\ncan either take along some friends (and it will be very beneficial if the group only \\nspeaks in English), or join an organised group which is a great way to make new \\nfriends.  \\nMake sure you take a boat tour to the Islands that also includes live narration, which \\nwill help you practise your listening skills in a fun and interesting way. \\nToronto \\nHarbour Tours organises trips to the islands, and there are many other tour providers \\nto choose from. \\n \\n10. Read and watch CTV \\nOne of the best way to practise English is to read and listen to things in English. What \\nbetter way to learn about the city than to watch the local news?  \\nYou can follow the news channel for Toronto (CTV Toronto). Check out their website - \\nhttp://toronto.ctvnews.ca/, or download their free app on your smartphone (search \\nfor CTV).'),\n",

Go to the Islands\\nYour trip to Toronto is not complete until you have explored North America’s \\nlargest car-free, urban community. Part residential, part recreational, the I slands \\nare quite an attraction in their own right, with peace and tranquillity, yet \\nadventure awaiting at every turn. If you want the best spot to photograph the city \\nskyline, take your camera (or phone) with you to the Toronto Islands and do not \\nmiss this opportunity to die for! \\n4. Sample some Craft Beer\\nTorontonians love beer, and your tour of the city would not be complete without \\ntrying one of their many craft beers. If alcoholic beverages are not your thing, one \\ncan still enjoy non-alcoholic beers or other beverages. \\nINTERMEDIATE LEVEL TIP: Ask specifically for Canadian craft beer in tap, so \\nthat you get the real, local drink (while practising your speaking ski lls). If \\nyou`re feeling adventurous, why not start a conversation with the bartender \\nand ask what the beer is made from.'),\n",

Go on a food tour\\nThe multicultural flavour of Toronto makes for an incredible food scene. From \\nfood trucks to international restaurants, it offers a bit of everything and you have \\nto try it all. Any type of cuisine that comes to mind is available in Toronto. There \\nare in fact more than 9,000 restaurants in the city, covering all tastes and \\nbudgets. Enjoy but watch your waistline. \\nBEGINNER LEVEL TIP: Find your own cuisine in Toronto and order your \\nfavourite dish in English (even if the menu is available in your own language). \\nThis will be familiar, fun and useful for your conversation skills.   \\n6. Go t o the Beach\\nToronto’s impressive shoreline means plenty of beaches to choose from. You \\ncould check out Ward’s Island, Woodbine Beach, or Hanlan’s Point – we \\nrecommend that you try at least one (if not all) of them. Weather permitting, why \\nnot try some surfing or a good old sunbathing session lazing in the sun? \\nINTERMEDIATE LEVEL TIP:  learn as much “at the beach vocabulary” as you \\ncan and try to use it all on your trip to the beach. That may include asking \\nsomeone: Is there a lifeguard at this beach? Where can I buy a swimsuit?   \\nHow much does a surf lesson cost? Where’s the nearest restroom?'),\n",

Famous for its breathtaking beauty and massive water flow, the falls consist of three main sections: Horseshoe Falls (the largest and most impressive), American Falls, and Bridal Veil Falls. Visitors can experience the falls from multiple viewpoints along the Niagara Parkway, but the most immersive experience is through the Hornblower Boat Cruise, where boats take passengers close enough to feel the mist. The area surrounding the falls offers attractions including Journey Behind the Falls, Skylon Tower observation deck, and Clifton Hill, a lively entertainment district filled with restaurants, museums, arcades, and attractions. Niagara Falls is accessible from Toronto in about 1.5 hours by car or GO Train, making it one of the most convenient and popular day trips for tourists visiting Canada.\",\n",

It is famous for its breathtaking beauty and massive water flow, consisting of three main sections: Horseshoe Falls (the largest and most impressive), American Falls, and Bridal Veil Falls. Visitors can experience the falls from multiple viewpoints along the Niagara Parkway, but the most immersive experience is through the Hornblower Boat Cruise, where boats take passengers close enough to feel the mist. The area surrounding the falls offers attractions including Journey Behind the Falls, Skylon Tower observation deck, and Clifton Hill, a lively entertainment district filled with restaurants, museums, arcades, and attractions. Niagara Falls is accessible from Toronto in about 1.5 hours by car or GO Train, making it one of the most convenient and popular day trips for tourists visiting Canada.\n"
